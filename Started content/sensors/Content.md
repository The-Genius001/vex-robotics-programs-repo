# Your first few practices
I would recommend that your first practice you go over the game for this year. You should go over designs of how to overcome the chalanges in the game. On your next practice, you might want to start by building a base. If your in iq you might also want to build the basic robot that vex released for your game. You can find it on the vex website. After you build your base you will want to look back at the game and decide which idea you think is best from the first practice. Eg if you liked a flywheel over a catipult because you think it is better, you build that. 





# sensors (vrc)
## camrea/vision sensor
the camera/vision sensor is a retangular piece of plastic that has a camera in it and 2 ports; one for a iq brain and one for a VRC brain. This sensor can tell your program what colors it can see. It can also host its own wifi. When you connect to it, you need to go to the ip "192.168.1.1". This ip is a self hosted site on the network that allows you to see what the camera sees in real time.

## color/gestor sensor
This sensor has 3 functions. It has LEDs on it to iluminate what is in front of it. It can detect colors, and detect how far away the color it is seeing is. It can detect the brightness of the color and can even detect gestors of an object infront of it. It tells you which direction an object above it it moving in 4 directions(up, down, left, right).

## buttons
A red button. Pretty easy to understand. It sends out a output of a 1 or a 0 (true or false). 1 it pressed and 0 is not pressed. This is a 3 wire sensor. If you need help conecting 3 wire sensors, please go to the conections folder.
